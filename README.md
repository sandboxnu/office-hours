# UBC Office Hours

This app helps student navigate and queue in office hours. It solves the complex office hour queue system, makes it more convenient for students to ask questions, and easier for TA/Professors to manage office hours.

The system was developed by Khoury College, but the forked project is adapted to use in UBCO.
