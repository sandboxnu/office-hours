# Khoury Office Hours

Khoury Office Hours provides a platform for classes at [Khoury College](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) to facilitate office hours and utilize data insights to decrease wait times. Students are able to ask questions and join automatically scheduled queues, and TA's are able to easily manage queues by helping students and limiting question load in stressful situations.

Khoury Office Hours was developed by [Sandbox](https://www.sandboxnu.com/), Northeastern's student-led software consultancy.
