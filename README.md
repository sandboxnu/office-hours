# Khoury Office Hours

Khoury Office Hours provides a platform for classes at [Khoury College](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) to facilitate office hours and utilize data insights to decrease wait times. Students are able to ask questions and join automatically scheduled queues, and TA's are able to easily manage queues by helping students and limiting question load in stressful situations.

Khoury Office Hours was developed by [Sandbox](https://www.sandboxnu.com/), Northeastern's student-led software consultancy. The project brought to Sandbox via Will Stenzel and Alex Grob in the Fall of 2019. Funny enough, it started as a Sandbox project in Spring 2020 as a React-Native mobile app. But as the pandemic developed, the team realized we needed a more robust solution to mediate office hours for the entire school. After initially rolling out to 4 classes in the Fall of 2020, the tool has now become a staple at Khoury, supporting about 20 classes semester over semester. The tool is even being used by classes at the University of British Columbia at the Okanagan campus.

As a lot of the original developers have graduated, and feature development slowed down, the school needs to rely on a consistent maintenance team to nurture the application. So we are archiving this repo, and active development will continue under the software department of Khoury College at [this fork](https://github.com/khouryapps/office-hours).

If you choose to build upon the platform, please ensure it will remain open-source. 

A special thank you to all developers who were on the team over the past 3 years, and leadership for their extended time coordinating with Khoury to make the app.
