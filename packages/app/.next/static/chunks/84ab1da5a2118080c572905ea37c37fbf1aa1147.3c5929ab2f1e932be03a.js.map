Get location item of current `scrollTop`\n * 3. [Render] Render visible items\n * 4. Get all the visible items height\n * 5. [Render] Update top item `margin-top` to fit the position\n *\n * Algorithm:\n * We split scroll bar into equal slice. An item with whatever height occupy the same range slice.\n * When `scrollTop` change,\n * it will calculate the item percentage position and move item to the position.\n * Then calculate other item position base on the located item.\n *\n * Concept:\n *\n * # located item\n * The base position item which other items position calculate base on.\n */\n\nvar List =\n/** @class */\nfunction () {\n  var List = /*#__PURE__*/function (_React$Component) {\n    _inherits(List, _React$Component);\n\n    var _super = _createSuper(List);\n\n    function List(props) {\n      var _this;\n\n      _classCallCheck(this, List);\n\n      _this = _super.call(this, props);\n      _this.listRef = React.createRef();\n      _this.itemElements = {};\n      _this.itemElementHeights = {};\n      /**\n       * Lock scroll process with `onScroll` event.\n       * This is used for `data` length change and `scrollTop` restore\n       */\n\n      _this.lockScroll = false;\n      /**\n       * Phase 2: Trigger render since we should re-calculate current position.\n       */\n\n      _this.onScroll = function (event) {\n        var _this$props = _this.props,\n            data = _this$props.data,\n            height = _this$props.height,\n            itemHeight = _this$props.itemHeight,\n            disabled = _this$props.disabled;\n        var _this$listRef$current = _this.listRef.current,\n            originScrollTop = _this$listRef$current.scrollTop,\n            clientHeight = _this$listRef$current.clientHeight,\n            scrollHeight = _this$listRef$current.scrollHeight;\n        var scrollTop = alignScrollTop(originScrollTop, scrollHeight - clientHeight); // Skip if `scrollTop` not change to avoid shake\n\n        if (scrollTop === _this.state.scrollTop || _this.lockScroll || disabled) {\n          return;\n        }\n\n        var scrollPtg = getElementScrollPercentage(_this.listRef.current);\n        var visibleCount = Math.ceil(height / itemHeight);\n\n        var _getRangeIndex = getRangeIndex(scrollPtg, data.length, visibleCount),\n            itemIndex = _getRangeIndex.itemIndex,\n            itemOffsetPtg = _getRangeIndex.itemOffsetPtg,\n            startIndex = _getRangeIndex.startIndex,\n            endIndex = _getRangeIndex.endIndex;\n\n        _this.setState({\n          status: 'MEASURE_START',\n          scrollTop: scrollTop,\n          itemIndex: itemIndex,\n          itemOffsetPtg: itemOffsetPtg,\n          startIndex: startIndex,\n          endIndex: endIndex\n        });\n\n        _this.triggerOnScroll(event);\n      };\n\n      _this.onRawScroll = function (event) {\n        var scrollTop = _this.listRef.current.scrollTop;\n\n        _this.setState({\n          scrollTop: scrollTop\n        });\n\n        _this.triggerOnScroll(event);\n      };\n\n      _this.triggerOnScroll = function (event) {\n        var onScroll = _this.props.onScroll;\n\n        if (onScroll && event) {\n          onScroll(event);\n        }\n      };\n\n      _this.getIndexKey = function (index, props) {\n        var mergedProps = props || _this.props;\n        var _mergedProps$data = mergedProps.data,\n            data = _mergedProps$data === void 0 ?
